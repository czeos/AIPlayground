### IV. The Wagner Group's Operations in Central Africa

#### A. Strategic Objectives

The Wagner Group's presence in Central Africa, particularly in the Central African Republic (CAR), is driven by several strategic objectives. First and foremost, the group aims to establish a foothold in resource-rich regions to exploit valuable natural resources such as diamonds, gold, and timber. Additionally, the Wagner Group seeks to expand Russia's geopolitical influence by supporting local regimes and destabilizing Western interests in the region. This dual approach of economic gain and political influence underpins Wagner's operations in Central Africa.

#### B. Military Operations

The Wagner Group has been involved in numerous military operations within Central Africa. These operations typically involve providing military training, security services, and direct combat support to local government forces. In the CAR, Wagner operatives have been instrumental in bolstering the government against various rebel groups and securing key strategic locations. Their tactics often include a combination of conventional military engagements and unconventional warfare, leveraging their experience in diverse combat environments.

One significant operation led by the Wagner Group in the CAR was the defense of the capital, Bangui, against a coalition of rebel forces in early 2021. Wagner operatives played a crucial role in repelling the rebel advance, securing the city's stability, and ensuring the continued rule of CAR's President Faustin-Archange Touadéra.

#### C. Economic Exploits

The exploitation of natural resources is a major component of the Wagner Group's activities in Central Africa. Wagner operatives have been involved in securing mining sites, managing resource extraction operations, and facilitating the transportation and sale of these resources. In return, Wagner often receives payment in the form of mining concessions or direct access to the extracted resources, which are then sold on the global market.

In the CAR, Wagner's involvement in the mining sector has been particularly pronounced. The group has secured several lucrative mining contracts and operates in regions rich in diamonds and gold. This economic exploitation not only funds Wagner's activities but also increases Russia's economic influence in the region.

#### D. Political Influence

Beyond military and economic activities, the Wagner Group exerts significant political influence in Central Africa. By providing security and military support to local governments, Wagner helps to stabilize regimes that are favorable to Russian interests. In the CAR, Wagner's support has been crucial for President Touadéra, who relies on their expertise and manpower to maintain control over the country.

Additionally, Wagner operatives engage in political advisory roles, assisting local leaders in shaping policies that align with Russian strategic goals. This political influence extends to election support, where Wagner has been involved in securing electoral processes and providing logistical assistance to favored candidates.
