### II. The Wagner Group

#### A. Overview

The Wagner Group, a private military company (PMC), operates in a gray zone between state and non-state actors. Established around 2014, it gained notoriety for its involvement in various global conflicts, including those in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, and several African nations. The group is widely believed to be funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to the Kremlin, although the Russian government has consistently denied any official connection.

##### Structure and Hierarchy

The Wagner Group's organizational structure is complex and often shrouded in secrecy. It operates more like a covert paramilitary organization than a conventional PMC. The group's command hierarchy is believed to mirror that of a regular military unit, with distinct ranks and divisions for different operational needs, including intelligence, logistics, and combat units.

Leadership within the Wagner Group has seen significant changes, particularly following the death of its founder, Dmitry Utkin, and the recent demise of Yevgeny Prigozhin under suspicious circumstances. These events have led to a reshuffling of the leadership, with new key figures emerging to fill the vacuum left by Utkin and Prigozhin. The current leadership is less publicly known, adding another layer of opacity to the organization's already secretive nature.

##### Key Figures and Leadership Changes Post-Prigozhin

The death of Yevgeny Prigozhin marked a significant turning point for the Wagner Group. Prigozhin was considered the financial backbone and a strategic mastermind behind many of the group's operations. His passing has triggered a period of uncertainty and potential power struggles within the organization. New leaders have stepped in, but their identities and the extent of their control remain largely concealed from the public eye.

Despite these changes, the group's operational capabilities and strategic objectives appear to remain consistent. The new leadership continues to focus on leveraging military prowess for both political influence and economic gain, particularly in resource-rich regions like Central Africa.

#### B. Operational Tactics

The Wagner Group employs a variety of operational tactics that allow it to achieve its objectives, often blending military and economic strategies.

##### Military Strategies

Militarily, the Wagner Group operates with a level of sophistication comparable to national armed forces. They employ advanced weaponry, engage in complex battlefield strategies, and utilize intelligence operations to outmaneuver their adversaries. Their tactics often involve a combination of direct combat, guerrilla warfare, and psychological operations designed to destabilize opponents and secure strategic advantages.

In conflict zones like Syria and Libya, the Wagner Group has demonstrated its ability to execute high-risk operations, including frontline assaults and deep reconnaissance missions. Their presence in these regions has often tipped the balance in favor of their allies, showcasing their effectiveness as a combat force.

##### Economic Ventures and Resource Control

Beyond their military engagements, the Wagner Group is deeply involved in various economic ventures, particularly in regions where they have established a military presence. One of their primary strategies involves securing control over natural resources such as oil, gas, and minerals. This control not only funds their operations but also provides leverage over local governments and other stakeholders.

In the Central African Republic (CAR), for instance, the Wagner Group has taken control of several key mining operations, extracting valuable resources like gold and diamonds. These economic activities are often conducted through a network of shell companies and local partnerships, making it difficult to trace the profits directly back to the group.

Their economic strategies also extend to providing security services to local elites and governments, further entrenching their influence in the regions they operate. This dual approach of combining military might with economic control allows the Wagner Group to maintain a significant presence and influence in multiple theaters of operation.
